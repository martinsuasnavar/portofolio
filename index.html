                        I am an 21 years old IT engineering student who seeks opportunities to grow and learn. To start off my IT career, I have choosen Front-end development of websites, as one of my passions is designing visuals. I already have previous experience by self-learning with languages like C#, by modifying videogames in Unity, so I believe that's a good base to have the logics for what is the world of programming in its whole. I don't like overlooking details that are troublesome at my eyes, so I can be perfectionist at my work.

                        Learning new front-end technologies and incorporate also back-end when the time is appropiate. Full Stack is my mayor objective.

                        <h2 class="title-text">What am I planning to implement in my website?</h2>
                        I want to incorporate JavaScript functionality to my website, as well as making the buttons workable. I am also planning to incorporate the React.Js framework once I get used with JavaScript. An option to switch between Dark and Light themes also seems like a cool idea, being it done in JavaScript. A switcher between Spanish and English languages also seems solid.
